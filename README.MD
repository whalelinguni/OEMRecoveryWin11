- Follow docuentation in OEM Recovery Tools. Use Repo for files (ScanState has all needed files included)
- Rename master_Autounattend.xml to Autounattend.xml and copy to ISO [for both OEM recovery settings (default with autounattend) and win11 tweaks (disable NRO, TPM, etc)]
- Should be a AIO for win11 install + OEM recovery creation.
